        Thanks for the report!

        Please focus on **what happens** and **how to reproduce it**.
        Everything else is optional.

        Before filing, a quick sanity check (no worries if you’re unsure):

        - If the behavior is documented but feels wrong or questionable,
          it might be better filed as a **design discussion** rather than a bug.
        - If something is unclear rather than broken, you may get a faster answer on
          [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) or in the
          [Kotlin Slack](https://slack-chats.kotlinlang.org/).
        - Please make sure the issue is in **kotlinx.coroutines itself**,
          not in Kotlin, a third-party library, or your own code.
        - If you suspect this might already be fixed, trying a recent version can help —
          but it’s okay if you can’t.

        If in doubt, just file the issue and describe what you see.

        Any form of reproducer is welcome.

        - A minimal, self-contained snippet is ideal
        - A small sample project is great
        - A real-world project or production code is also fine if isolating the issue is hard

        If the code is private, please mention that — we can discuss alternatives.
